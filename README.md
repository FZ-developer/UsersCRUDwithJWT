# 👥 Users CRUD implementing JWT 👥

CRUD was performed on a "Users" table, and JWT was implemented.

# 💡 Requirements

👤 Each user will have an email and password, and will be assigned a role by the administrator (either "Administrator" or "UserOnly"), each with its own set of functionalities.

🔑 Authentication and authorization will be handled using JWT to ensure secure access to the API.

👨‍💻 Users with the "Administrator" role will be able to view the list of registered users, as well as add, modify, or delete users.

👨‍💼 Users with the "UserOnly" role will only be able to view the list of registered users.
